### Social Profiles Icons

**Profiles supported with brand colors:**

github, stack overflow, linkedin, dribbble, twitter, facebook, pinterest, instagram, soundcloud, wordpress, youtube, flickr, google plus, tumblr, foursquare.

To have a social icon close the social link profile (or username) it is enough to set a `network` the name of the Social Network (es: 'Stack Overflow').
